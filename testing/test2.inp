# This is a test script, containing a transcript with commands to and expected
# outputs from java canfield.Main --text.  
#
# The first line (above) is removed from the input and used as
# the --seed argument to canfield.Main.  When run with the same seed,
# canfield.Main will produce the same sequence of deals, allowing reproducible
# results.
#
# All lines starting with a "> " prompt, or starting with #, are taken to
# be inputs to the program.  All others are taken to be expected output,
# and compared with actual output.
